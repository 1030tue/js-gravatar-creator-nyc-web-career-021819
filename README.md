## Welcome to _IDENTICON™️_ AKA _GRAVATAR™️_

---

We are going to be building out an Identicon generator using JavaScript and some DOM manipulation.

---

An Identicon is a visual representation of a hash value, usually of an IP address, that serves to identify a user of a computer system as a form of avatar while protecting the users' privacy. You can read more about [Identicons here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identicon)

---

The completed application looks like this:

---

When a user inputs their name, the Identicon should dynamically produce an avatar for them. We've provided you with some starter code and will walk through the desired output of each function. It's up to you however to implement this functionality.

---

Good luck everyone!
